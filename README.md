# HighRes - Auto Apply Jobs

HighRes is an automated job application system designed to streamline the job search process by automatically filling out application forms from job listings you're interested in.

## Overview

Finding a job often means filling out dozens of similar application forms across various platforms. Auto Apply automates this repetitive task by:

1. Storing your resume data once
2. Automatically filling out application forms
3. Handling text fields, dropdowns, file uploads, and even custom questions
4. Managing the status of all your applications in one place

## Features

- **Automated Application**: Uses browser automation to fill out job application forms
- **Queue Management**: Tracks application status (queued, in progress, applied, failed, needs review)
- **Smart Form Detection**: Identifies and fills out various form types
- **Resume Upload**: Automatically uploads your resume to application forms
- **Demographic Information**: Handles standard demographic questions
- **Success Verification**: Takes screenshots as proof of completed applications
- **Manual Review Option**: Flags applications that need human intervention


## AI-Powered Application Process
HighRes utilizes advanced AI agents to ensure accurate form filling and prevent application spam:

**Smart Form Analysi**s: AI agents detect form structure, field types, and required information, adapting to different application platforms automatically
**Contextual Response Generation**: Uses Gemini AI to generate personalized responses to open-ended questions like "Why do you want to work here?" based on the company, job description, and your resume
**Intelligent Error Handling**: Identifies form validation errors and adjusts inputs accordingly
**Anti-Spam Mechanisms**:
    1. Implements application rate limiting to prevent excessive submissions
    2. Tracks previously applied positions to avoid duplicate applications
    3. Analyzes job requirements to ensure you're only applying to relevant positions
    4. Monitors application success rate to detect and address potential issues
**Quality Assurance**: Jobs requiring complex inputs or encountering unusual form patterns are flagged for manual review rather than submitting potentially incorrect information

## Usage

1. **Add Jobs to Queue**: Use the Add Job page to add job listings to the queue
2. **Monitor Progress**: View the Queue page to see the status of all applications
3. **Review Applications**: Check the "Needs Review" tab for applications that require manual intervention
4. **Verify Success**: Click "See Proof" on applied jobs to view screenshots of successful applications
